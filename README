This is the source for the article series "EC2 Continuous Deployment: Hello world" located at

http://jeppenejsum.wordpress.com/2009/05/03/ec2-continuous-deployment-hello-world/


The files contain a complete end-to-end example for doing continuous deployment:

 - Building a Lift webapp with Gradle (Need Gradle with the Scala plugin)
 - Launch new EC2 instance
 - Configure & Deploy EC2 instance using Chef
 - Run simple integration test
 - Shutdown EC2 instance

You need to enter your Amazon AWS credentials in the top of build.gradle in order to try the examples.

If this is done, you can type

gradle integrationTest

to build, deploy and test the webapp.


Feel free to comment. Enjoy!
